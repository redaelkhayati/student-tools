This platform offers a login and sign-up feature specifically designed for students. Upon logging in, students can generate bulletins based on their marks and use a calculator.

## Project Overview
This students tool website project, is developed by Reda El Khayati (@redaelkhayati) and Mostapha Bayi (@Bayi-Mostapha) , our main goal is to provide a website that is intuitive, efficient, and offers essential features to enhance the user experience.

The project focuses on simplicity and functionality, offering the following key features:

1. *Grade Sheet Generator*: The website includes a grade sheet generator that allows students to input their grades and obtain a downloadable grade sheet in pdf format.
